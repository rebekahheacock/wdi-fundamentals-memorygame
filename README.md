## Memory Game: Unit Homework for WDI Fundamentals

In order to apply JavaScript concepts covered in the [pre-work](http://fundamentals.generalassemb.ly/), all pre-work lessons will work towards building a memory game app. Your development of this game will exercise your ability to implement logic with JavaScript and so much more!
